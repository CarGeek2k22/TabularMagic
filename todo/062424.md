### new features brainstorming

- some type of improved visualization of categorical variables
- logger compatability
- adding more statistical tests for eda()
- backwards selection, forwards selection, general stepwise for lm()
- logistic version of lm()

implement glm
- check for dispersion for poisson? Look at recitation slides from spring 2024
- make sure it works with log, poly(, degree), ^2

Maybe also implement:
- gam
- kernel regression



### other quality of life

- reordering statistics in outputs




### testing/debugging

- ensure correct info/warning output
- inverse scaling of y variable for lm()



### way into the future...

- dash interface...?
- auto latex report generator
