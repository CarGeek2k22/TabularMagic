# TabularMagic
TabularMagic is a comprehensive toolkit that seamlessly integrates scikit-learn and statsmodels algorithms, enabling rapid exploratory statistical and machine learning modeling of tabular data. By streamlining the processes of exploratory data analysis, regression analysis, and machine learning model benchmarking, TabularMagic alleviates the common headaches associated with these tasks. Leveraging TabularMagic empowers users to swiftly explore datasets, conduct regression analyses with ease, and effortlessly compute baseline performance metrics across a wide range of popular machine learning models. Designed specifically to accelerate data science routines on small clinical datasets such as NHANES, TabularMagic excels in handling datasets with fewer than 10,000 examples. 

Under active development.

## Why does TabularMagic exist?

While numerous autoML solutions have emerged to streamline industry-scale data science workflows, user-friendly options tailored for working with small tabular datasets remain scarce. TabularMagic strives to fill this void, offering a straightforward Python interface for common data science routines. This package relieves users from the tedious tasks often associated with such projects â€“ maintaining separate train and test data, one-hot encoding and scaling features, and perhaps most notably, benchmarking various machine learning models, many of which necessitate intricate hyperparameter tuning. With TabularMagic, say goodbye to the endless need to reference documentation for pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. 


## Installation and dependencies

TabularMagic can be installed via pip. The Python scripts below handle 
package setup and pip installation. 

To install TabularMagic: 
```
git clone https://github.com/ajy25/TabularMagic.git
python tm-build.py install
```

To uninstall TabularMagic:
```
python tm-build.py uninstall
```

TabularMagic is built on top of the standard Python data science stack (scikit-learn, statsmodels, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib). 
A full list of dependencies is available in ```./requirements.txt```.


## Getting started

We can build a TabularMagic object from a provided dataset. The TabularMagic object allows for rapid exploratory data analysis. 
```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tabularmagic.api import TabularMagic
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes

# load the dataset
diabetes_data = load_diabetes()
df = pd.DataFrame(data=diabetes_data.data, columns=diabetes_data.feature_names)
df['target'] = diabetes_data.target

# create a TabularMagic object
tm = TabularMagic(df, test_size=0.2, split_seed=42)
print(tm)
```

TabularMagic makes exploratory data analysis easy. Note that all TabularMagic plotting methods close figures before returning them for easier use with IPython notebooks. When working outside of IPython notebooks, returned figures must be reshown. 
```
def reshow(fig: plt.Figure):
    new_fig = plt.figure(figsize=fig.get_size_inches())
    new_manager = new_fig.canvas.manager
    new_manager.canvas.figure = fig
    fig.set_canvas(new_manager.canvas)
    plt.show()

train_eda = tm.eda()
print(train_eda.continuous_summary_statistics())
reshow(train_eda.plot_distribution('target'))
reshow(train_eda.plot_continuous_pairs(['target', 'age', 'bmi', 'bp']))
```

TabularMagic makes regression analysis easy via R-like formulas.
```
lm_report = tm.lm(
    formula='target ~ age + bmi'
)
lm_report.statsmodels_summary()
lm_report.train_report().set_outlier_threshold(2).plot_diagnostics(
    show_outliers=True)
```

TabularMagic makes machine learning model benchmarking easy. Nested k-fold cross validation handles hyperparameter selection and model evaluation on training data. The selected models are evaluated on the withheld testing data as well. Note that nested cross validation is computationally expensive and could take some time to run; to disable nested cross validation, simply set `outer_cv = None`.
```
from tabularmagic.api.mlR import LinearR, TreeEnsembleR, SVMR
models =[
    LinearR(),
    LinearR('l1'),
    LinearR('l2'),
    TreeEnsembleR('random_forest', n_jobs=-1),
    TreeEnsembleR('adaboost', n_jobs=-1),
    SVMR('rbf', n_jobs=-1)
]
report = tm.ml_regression(
    models=models   # 5-fold cross validation for hyperparameter search
    y_var='target',
    X_vars=['age', 'bmi', 'bp', 's1', 's2'],
    outer_cv=5      # 5-fold cross validation for model evaluation
)
print(report.fit_statistics('train'))
print(report.cv_fit_statistics())
print(report.fit_statistics('test'))
reshow(report.model_report('TreeEnsembleR(adaboost)').test_report().plot_obs_vs_pred())
```
