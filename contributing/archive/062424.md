### new features brainstorming

- some type of improved visualization of categorical variables
- logger compatability
- adding more statistical tests for eda()
- backwards selection, forwards selection, general stepwise for lm()
- logistic version of lm()

implement glm
Priority:
- In reports do something similar to .metrics where you return plots directly
 from report instead of having to do .train_report or .test_report. Similar to what
 metrics is doing.

- create docstrigs for lr test and partial f test
- add tests to all glm classes

- fix binomialglm. Make it so that it works with a binary variable encoded with
strings by automatically converting everything to 1s and 0s. 

- Fix residual calculation with binomial glm
- add deviance residuals for poisson
- silence output in countglm
- finish implementing step for count glm class
- test step for all glm functions

- get AIC and use to compare poisson and nb
- https://rdrr.io/cran/pscl/src/R/odTest.R
- Implement goodness of fit tests for poisson and nb (reci 9)
- Create pearson residual vs. fitted plot
- see if its possible to implement a plot_hanging_rootogram for poisson
- Test rootogram and compare with r
- In binomial report class also set up output for decision boundary and metric
- Make count regresion - automatically detects overdispersion. Output should
  state the general heuristic used

- make sure it works with log, poly(, degree), ^2

Maybe also implement:
- gam
- kernel regression



### other quality of life

- reordering statistics in outputs




### testing/debugging

- ensure correct info/warning output
- inverse scaling of y variable for lm()
- Test all families and links in GLM. Make sure all families
  and link functions are implemented from Statmodels
- Test negative binomial glm and pearson residual plot



### way into the future...

- dash interface...?
- auto latex report generator
